Working with error logs
=======================

The application code contains error logging. Log entries are made on hard fault exceptions and assert failures (in debug configuration). To read and clear
log entries, you can use the provided tools in the RevvyFirmware repository.

> This needs to be expanded. I remember the general idea, but neither the implementation details, nor the tools.
