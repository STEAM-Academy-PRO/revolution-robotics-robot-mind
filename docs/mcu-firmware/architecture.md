Software architecture
=====================

This firmware was built using CGlue, an in-house developed firmware architecture and toolkit. Most of the custom-developed firmware is organized into
software components that are connected by a runtime layer generated by CGlue. The component models are individually described in the components' folders,
the port connections are configured in the `project.json` file in the root folder.
Because CGlue is missing some features, some of the software components contain manual modifications to the generated component structure or runtime layer.
An example for this is the communication layer: currently, it is not possible to describe, which command IDs belong to which command handler functions,
so these connections are done in a manually written source file.

The other substantial part of the firmware is the code provided by Atmel/Microchip. Some of their SDK is used as-is, but other parts, for example the
SERCOM codes have been modified, replaced or removed from the package.

> This needs to be expanded. CGlue is complicated. It has it's own [documentation](https://github.com/STEAM-Academy-PRO/revolution-robotics-CGlue?tab=readme-ov-file#cglue--).

Developing with CGlue
---------------------

* Create a new software component: `cglue --new-component ComponentName`
* Update generated component code based on modification of the component model: `cglue --update-component ComponentName [--cleanup]`
* Generate runtime based on the project.json configuration: `cglue --generate --cglue-output=rrrc/generated_runtime [--cleanup]`
  The generated files are: `rrrc/generated_runtime.h` and `rrrc/generated_runtime.c`
* Generate makefile for compilation: `python -m tools.generate_makefile [--cleanup]`
